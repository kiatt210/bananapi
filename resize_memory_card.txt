Do this only right after flashing the image on the SD-Card, so if anything goes wrong you do not lose any data.

sudo fdisk /dev/mmcblk0

In fdisk:
Press ‘p’ to print the partition table:

Disk /dev/mmcblk0: 15.9 GB, 15931539456 bytes
4 heads, 16 sectors/track, 486192 cylinders, total 31116288 sectors
Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disk identifier: 0x00084078

   Device Boot           Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/mmcblk0p1            2048      124927       61440   83  Linux
/dev/mmcblk0p2          124928    31116287    15495680   83  Linux

Press 'd' to delete a partition:
Enter '2' to choose the second partition.
Press 'n' to create a new partition:
Enter 'p' to select primary as partition type.
Partition number: enter to accept 2 as default partition number.
First sector: enter to accept default.
This should be 124928
Last sector: enter to accept default.
Press 'w' to write the new partition table.
Reboot to force the kernel to recognise the new partition table.

sudo reboot

After the system has come back up you still have to resize the partition.

sudo resize2fs /dev/mmcblk0p2
